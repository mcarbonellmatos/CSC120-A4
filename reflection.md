Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
It's a bit complicated but is definetly more organized and helps understand the code better.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think everything works but it took me so long. Something that helped me a lot was W3schools as I found a lot of new things to implement in the code. I definetly believe if you are going to take this course you will need to searvh by yourself more things about Java as it gets more difficult each assignment.
